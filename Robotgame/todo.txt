- 
- BFS
    - Cooperative.  Factor in other robot's planned routes when generating a path
- Have a state marker that we finished without running out of time
    - If we detect we ran out of time, fall back to a cheaper strategy
- When evenly matched and lower on health, flee
    - Flee strategies
        - Run towards closest high level friendly robot for protection
        - Find the closest, largest area with empty space in it for ease of movement

- If we have an enemy pinned into a spawn tile and the next turn is a spawn turn, take the hit and stay there so they die
- If we're winning in the last 10 turns (after last spawn), run away and avoid getting attacked at all costs
- Consider strategy A/B testing in-game
- Have a zoning strategy. Assign bots to N E S W areas and have them mark enemies in those areas for kill in a list of closest / easiest
    - Balance bots between zones as needed
